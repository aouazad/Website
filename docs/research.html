<p>Place-based investments can have unintended general equilibrium
effects and face challenges of time inconsistency. This paper simulates
the granular impact of alternative spatial and temporal designs of such
investments, using Quantitative Spatial Models where the strategy of the
policymaker is endogenized, with time-consistent policy analysis or
policies with commitment. It can apply to sunk, fixed costs investments
in transportation infrastructure, levees, and other location-based
investments. Applying this framework to the 1936 Flood Control Act, the
largest investment in flood control infrastructure in US history
protecting 5% of land, the study examines the general equilibrium
effects of levee investments on housing prices, population density, and
racial demographics over eight decades. Protected neighborhoods
initially had lower property values, higher minority shares, and greater
flood risk, but experienced sustained property appreciation and changes
in population density. Structural analysis reveals that optimal levee
designs prioritize high-density areas, reduce price capitalization, and
minimize urban sprawl. Policymakers who cannot commit to long-term plans
tend to overbuild and maintain larger systems compared to those with
time-consistent strategies.</p>

<p>In the face of rising climate risk, financial institutions may adapt
by transferring such risk to securitizers that have the skill and
expertise to build diversified pools, such as Mortgage-Backed
Securities. In diversified pools, exposure to climate risk may be a drop
in the ocean of cash flows. This paper builds a data set of the entire
securitization chain from mortgage-level to MBS deal-level cash flows,
and observes the prices of the tranches at monthly frequency. Wildfires
lead to higher rates of prepayment and foreclosure at the mortgage
level, and larger losses during foreclosure sales. At the MBS deal
level, a lower spatial concentration of dollar balances (lower spatial
dollar Herfindahl), a lower spatial correlation in wildfire events
(within-deal correlation), leads to a lower exposure to wildfire events.
These quantifiable metrics of diversification identify those existing
deals whose design makes them resilient to climate change. This paper
builds optimal deals by finding the portfolio weights in an asset demand
system that targets return and risk. Extrapolating wildfire risk using a
granular wildfire probability model and temperature projections in 2050,
we build climate resilient MBSs whose returns are minimally impacted by
wildfire risk even as they supply mortgage credit to wildfire prone
areas. Finally, we test whether the market prices the sensitivity of
each deal’s cash flow to wildfire risk.</p>

Multiplicity: A Systematic Approach using Homotopies, with an

<p>Discrete choice models with social interactions or spillovers may
exhibit multiple equilibria. This paper provides a systematic approach
to enumerating them for a quantitative spatial model with discrete
locations, social interactions, and elastic housing supply. The approach
relies on two homotopies. A homotopy is a smooth function that
transforms the solutions of a simpler city where solutions are known, to
a city with heterogeneous locations and finite supply elasticity. The
first homotopy is that, in the set of cities with perfectly elastic
floor surface supply, an economy with heterogeneous locations is
homotopic to an economy with homogeneous locations, whose solutions can
be comprehensively enumerated. Such an economy is epsilon close to an
economy whose equilibria are the zeros of a system of polynomials. This
is a well-studied area of mathematics where the enumeration of
equilibria can be guaranteed. The second homotopy is that a city with
perfectly elastic housing supply is homotopic to a city with an
arbitrary supply elasticity. In a small number of cases, the path may
bifurcate and a single path yields two or more equilibria. By running
the method on thousands of cities, we obtain a large number of
equilibria. Each equilibrium has different population distributions. We
provide a method that is computationally feasible for economies with a
large number of locations choices, with an empirical application to the
City of Chicago. There exist multiple “counterfactual Chicagos”
consistent with the estimated parameters. Population distribution,
prices, and welfare are not uniquely pinned down by amenities. The
paper’s method can be applied to models in trade and IO. Further
applications of algebraic geometry are suggested.</p>

<p>Using the government-sponsored enterprises’ sharp securitization
rules, this paper provides evidence that, in the aftermath of natural
disasters, lenders are more likely to approve mortgages that can be
securitized, thereby transferring climate risk. The identification
strategy uses the time-varying conforming loan limits above which the
government-sponsored enterprises do not securitize mortgages. Natural
disasters lead to more securitization right below the limit, suggesting
an increased option value of securitization. A model identified using
indirect inference simulates increasing disaster risk without GSEs.
Mortgage credit supply would decline in flood zones and lenders would
have a greater incentive to screen mortgages.</p>

<p>Climate change poses new risks for real estate assets. Given that the
majority of home buyers use a loan to pay for their homes and the
majority of these loans are purchased by the Government Sponsored
Enterprises (GSEs), it is important to understand how rising natural
disaster risk affects the mortgage finance market. The climate
securitization hypothesis (CSH) posits that, in the aftermath of natural
disasters, lenders strategically react to the GSEs conforming loan
securitization rules that create incentives that foster both moral
hazard and adverse selection effects. The climate risks bundled into GSE
mortgage-backed securities emerge because of the complex securitization
chain that creates weak monitoring and screening incentives. We survey
the recent theoretical literature and empirical literature exploring
screening incentive effects. Using regression discontinuity methods, we
test key hypotheses presented in the securitization literature with a
focus on securitization dynamics immediately after major hurricanes. Our
evidence supports the CSH. We address the data construction issues posed
by LaCour-Little et. al. and show that their concerns do not affect our
main results. Under the current rules of the game, climate risks
exacerbates the established lemons problem commonly found in loan
securitization markets.</p>

<p>The paper presents a dynamic model of neighborhood segregation where
fee motivated real estate brokers match sellers optimally either to
minority or to white buyers. In an initially all-white neighborhood,
real estate brokers thus either keep the neighborhood in a steady-state
white equilibrium or trigger racial transition by matching sellers to
minority buyers, a process called blockbusting. Racial transition leads
to a higher rate of property turnover in the neighborhood once the
fraction of minorities has reached a tipping point—but racial transition
also leads to lower prices, and this is the trade-off faced by a broker.
The model shows that with multiple brokers, blockbusting profit per
broker is lower as brokers free ride on each other’s groundbreaking
efforts. The model predicts that racial transition will happen in the
neighborhood when (i) the number of brokers is limited, (ii) racial
preferences lie in an intermediate range, (iii) the arrival rate of
offers is intermediate. Otherwise, real estate brokers steer white
households toward white buyers.</p>

Displacement, Unemployment, and Crime: Evidence from Danish Microdata
and Reforms</a></h2>
<p><em>Journal of the European Economic Association</em> , Volume 18,

<p>joint with Patrick Bennett</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>This paper matches a comprehensive Danish employer-employee data set
with individual crime records from offenses to prison terms to estimate
the impact of layoffs on crime. We focus on displaced individuals:
high-tenure workers who lose employment during a mass-layoff event.
Pre-displacement data suggest no evidence of endogenous selection of
workers for displacement during mass-layoffs: first, displaced workers’
propensity to commit crime exhibits no significantly increasing trend
prior to displacement; second, the crime rates of workers who will be
displaced and who will not be displaced are not significantly different.
The impact of displacement on crime is substantial: displaced workers’
probability to commit any crime increases by 0.52 ppts in the first
year. This effect comes mostly from property crime (+0.38 ppt). The
probability of crime spikes again 4 years and 7 years post-displacement.
The spikes are greater in areas with higher unemployment, and are driven
by high-school educated single males. This paper presents an explanation
for such pattern, driven by new active labor market laws in Denmark. The
spikes of crime match the introduction of active labor market policies,
and the exhaustion of passive benefits. Early cohorts’ eligibility to
unemployment is unexpectedly set to their past number of weeks of
employment, generating a discontinuity in eligibility, where individuals
right at the margin of eligibility see higher crime than individuals
right below the eligibility limit.</p>

</div>
<p>This article develops a general equilibrium model of location choice
where mortgage approval rates determine household-specific choice sets.
Estimation of the model using San Francisco Bay area data reveals that
the price sensitivity of borrowing constraints explains about two-thirds
of the price elasticity of neighborhood demand. General equilibrium
analysis of the 2000–2006 relaxation of lending standards predicts the
following impacts on prices and neighborhood demographics: (i) an
increase in house prices accompanied by a compression of the price
distribution and (ii) a reduction in the isolation of Whites reflecting
gentrification. Both predictions are supported by empirical
observation.</p>

<p>This paper explores the effects of changes in lending standards on
racial segregation within metropolitan areas. Such changes affect
neighborhood choices as well as aggregate prices and quantities in the
housing market. Using the credit boom of 2000-2006 as a large-scale
experiment, we put forward an IV strategy that predicts the relaxation
of credit standards as the result of a credit supply shock predominantly
affecting liquidity-constrained banks. The relaxed lending standards led
to significant outflows of Whites from black and from racially mixed
neighborhoods: without such credit supply shock, black households would
have had between 2.3 and 5.1 percentage points more white neighbors in
2010.</p>

<p>We use quantile regressions to evaluate the higher moments of future
earnings. First, we evaluate the in-sample relations between current
firm-level attributes and the moments of lead return on equity, ROE. We
show that: (1) as current ROE increases lead ROE tends to increase,
become more disperse, and more leptokurtic—i.e., fat-tailed; (2) loss
firms tend to have lower, more disperse, and more left-skewed lead ROE;
(3) as accruals increase lead ROE tends to decrease and become more
disperse; and, (4) firms with higher leverage and/or lower payout ratios
tend to have greater dispersion in lead ROE. Second, we show that the
in-sample relations generate reliable out-of-sample predictions of the
standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of lead ROE. Moreover, when
compared to predictions obtained via alternative approaches, our
out-of-sample predictions always contain incremental information content
and are typically more reliable. Finally, we evaluate the relation
between higher moments and market-based variables. These analyses
demonstrate that equity prices are increasing in the variance and
skewness of lead ROE but decreasing in the kurtosis of lead ROE. Credit
spreads are increasing in the variance and kurtosis of lead return on
assets, ROA, and decreasing in the skewness of lead ROA.</p>

<p>Financial depth is the fuel of economic growth. Yet, the same fuel,
when excessive and triggered by a shock of flame, can engender an
economic crisis. For decades, the economics literature studied these two
effects separately, building independently massive cases in favor of and
against financial deepening. Only since the mid-2000s, the economics
literature recognized that the positive and negative aspects of finance
should be considered jointly. This innovation has prompted an
exploration of the trade-offs involved in various aspects of financial
development, such as depth, inclusion, composition, and variety.
Likewise, it has induced a new type of policy debate regarding monetary
and financial affairs, a debate that takes into account the trade-offs
intrinsic in financial development (see, for instance, World Bank
(2013)). And from this debate, a diversity of policy reforms have been
implemented across the world, from financial macroprudential policies to
monetary policy frameworks that monitor credit and asset price
growth.</p>

<p>In the face of current challenges due to a pandemic, urban protests,
an affordability crisis, and a series of other shocks to the quality of
urban life, is the desirability of housing in dense urban settings at a
turning point? Assessing the future of cities’ long term trends remains
an empirical question. The first part of this chapter describes the
short-run dynamics of the housing market in 2020. Evidence from prices
and price-to-rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience. Zip
code-level evidence suggests a short-run trend towards suburbanization,
and some impacts of urban protests on house prices. The second part of
the chapter analyzes the long-run dynamics of urban growth between 1970
and 2010. It analyzes what, in such urban growth, is explained by
short-run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as education,
industrial specialization, industrial diversification, urban
segregation, and housing supply elasticity. This chapter’s original
results as well as a large established body of literature suggest that
fundamentals are the key drivers of growth, and that the shocks
considered in this paper have not had historically a measurable
long-term impact on metropolitan population growth. The chapter
illustrates this finding with two case studies: the New York City
housing market after September 11, 2001; and the San Francisco Bay Area
in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both areas
rebounded strongly after these shocks, suggesting the resilience of the
urban metropolis.</p>

<h2>Estimating Perceptions of Discrimination: Experimental Economics in
Schools</h2>

<p>We put forward a new experimental economics design with monetary
incentives to estimate students’ per- ceptions of grading
discrimination. We use this design in a large field experiment which
involved 1200 British students in grade 8 classrooms across 29 schools.
In this design, students are given an endowment that they can invest on
a task where payoff depends on performance. The task is a written verbal
test which is graded nonanonymously by their teacher, in a random half
of the classrooms, and graded anonymously by an external examiner in the
other random half of the classrooms. We find significant evidence that
students’ choices reflect perceptions of biases in teachers’ grading
practices. Our results suggest systematic gender effects: students
invest more with male teachers. Moreover, if we use the choices made
with an external examiner as a benchmark, this result seems to come from
two effects which complement each other: when comparing students’
choices with their teacher to those made with an external examiner, we
find that male students invest less with female teachers while female
students invest more with male teachers.</p>

<h2>Using Compulsory Mobility to Identify School Quality and Peer

<p>Education production functions that feature school and student fixed
effects are identified using students’ school mobility. However, student
mobility is driven by factors like parents’ labour market shocks and
divorce. Movers experience large achievement drops, are more often
minority and free meal students, and sort endogenously into peer groups
and school types. We exploit an English institutional feature whereby
some students must change schools between grades 2 and 3. We find no
evidence of endogenous sorting of such compulsory movers across peer
groups or school types. Non-compulsory movers bias school quality
estimates downward by as much as 20% of a SD.</p>

<h2>Assessed by a Teacher Like Me: Race and Teacher Assessments</h2>

<p>Do teachers assess same-race students more favorably? This paper uses
nationally representative data on teacher assessments of student ability
that can be compared with test scores to determine whether teachers give
better as- sessments to same-race students. The data set follows
students from kindergarten to grade 5, a period dur- ing which racial
gaps in test scores increase rapidly. Teacher assessments comprise up to
twenty items mea- suring specific skills. Using a unique within-student
and within-teacher identification and while controlling for
subject-specific test scores, I find that teachers do assess same-race
students more favorably. Effects ap- pear in kindergarten and persist
thereafter. Robustness checks suggest that: student behavior does not
explain this effect; same-race effects are evident in teacher as-
sessments of most of the skills; grading “on the curve” should be
associated with lower assessments; and mea- surement error in
assessments or test scores does not significantly affect the estimates.

<h2>The Transmission of Shocks in Endogenous Financial Networks: A
Structural Approach</h2>

<p>The paper uses bank- and instrument-level data on asset holdings and
liabilities to identify and estimate a general equilibrium model of
trade in financial instruments. Bilateral ties are formed as each bank
selects the size and the diversification of its assets and liabilities.
Shocks propagate due to the response, rather than the size, of bilateral
ties to such shocks. This general equilibrium propagation of shocks
reveals a financial network where the strength of a tie is determined by
the sensitivity of an instrument’s return to other instruments’ returns.
General equilibrium analysis predicts the propagation of real, financial
and policy shocks. The network’s shape adjusts endogenously in response
to shocks, to either amplify or mitigate partial equilibrium shocks. The
network exhibits key theoretical properties: (i) more connected networks
lead to less amplification of partial equilibrium shocks, (ii) the
influence of a bank’s equity is independent of the size of its holdings;
(ii) more risk-averse banks are more diversified, lowering their own
volatility but increasing their influence on other banks. The general
equilibrium based network model is structurally estimated on
disaggregated data for the universe of French banks. We used the
estimated network to assess the effects of ECB quantitative easing
policy on asset prices, balance-sheets, individual bank distress risk,
and networks systemicness.</p>

<p>The paper uses disaggregated data on asset holdings and liabilities
to estimate a general equilibrium model where each institution
determines the diversification and size of the asset and liability sides
of its balance-sheet. The model endogenously generates two types of
financial networks: (i) a network of institutions when two institutions
share common asset or liability holdings or when an institution holds an
asset that is the liability of another. In both cases demand/supply
decisions by one institution affect the value of other institutions’
holdings/liabilities, (ii) a network of financial instruments implied by
the distribution of assets and liabilities within and across
institutions. A change in the price of one asset induces change in
demand/supply for all other assets, thus generating price comovement.
The general equilibrium analysis predicts the propagation of real,
financial and regulatory shocks as well as the change in the network
caused by the shock.</p>

<h2>Market Frictions, Arbitrage, and the Capitalization of
Amenities</h2>
<p>Amine Ouazad &amp; Romain Rancière</p>
<p><em>NBER Working paper</em> 25701, March 2019, <a

<p>The price-amenity arbitrage is a cornerstone of spatial economics, as
the response of land and house prices to shifts in the quality of local
amenities and public goods is typically used to reveal households’
willingness to pay for amenities. With informational, time, and cash
constraints, households’ ability to arbitrage across locations with
different amenities (demographics, crime, education, housing) depends on
their ability to compare locations and to finance the swap of houses.
Arbitrageurs with deep pockets and better search and matching technology
can take advantage of price dispersions and unexploited trade
opportunities. We develop a disaggregated search and matching model of
the housing market with endogenously bargained prices, identified on
transaction-level data from the universe of deeds for 6,400+
neighborhoods of the Chicago metropolitan area, matched with
school-level test scores and geocoded criminal offenses. Price-amenity
gradients reflect preferences and the capitalization of trading
opportunities, which are arbitraged away in the frictionless limit. Thus
the time-variation in hedonic pricing coefficients partly reflects the
time variation in search and credit frictions. Our model is able to
explain that, between the peak of the housing boom and its trough, the
sign of the price-amenity gradient flipped, due to the decline in
trading opportunities in lower-amenity neighborhoods and due to the
lower capitalization of trading opportunities in house prices.</p>

<h2>Coastal Flood Risk in the Mortgage Market: Storm Surge Models’
Predictions vs. Flood Insurance Maps</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02977">Link to the Arxiv
repository</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Prior literature has argued that flood insurance maps may not capture
the extent of flood risk. This paper performs a granular assessment of
coastal flood risk in the mortgage market by using physical simulations
of hurricane storm surge heights instead of using FEMA’s flood insurance
maps. Matching neighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with
mortgage files suggests that coastal flood risk may be large:
originations and securitizations in storm surge areas have been rising
sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when using flood insurance
maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of originations occur in
storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains. The share of agency
mortgages increases in storm surge areas, yet remains stable in the
flood insurance 100-year floodplain. Mortgages in storm surge areas are
more likely to be complex: non-fully amortizing features such as
interest-only or adjustable rates. Households may also be more
vulnerable in storm surge areas: median household income is lower, the
share of African Americans and Hispanics is substantially higher, the
share of individuals with health coverage is lower. Price-to-rent ratios
are declining in storm surge areas while they are increasing in flood
insurance areas. This paper suggests that uncovering future financial
flood risk requires scientific models that are independent of the flood
insurance mapping process.</p>

<p>This report documents that, at a local level, there are stark
contrasts in access to credit for African Americans: Interest rates on
business loans, bank branch density, local banking concentration in the
residential mortgage market, and the growth of local businesses are
markedly different in majority Black neighborhoods. Several policy
approaches are suggested: First, a more granular approach to banking
supervision may be needed; microgeographic data in 2021 provides a much
closer look at the banking practices of major banks and nonbank lenders
than in 1977, when the Community Reinvestment Act was signed into law.
Second, the number of African American minority depository institutions
(MDIs) has been declining and policy or private-sector support is likely
needed (Pike, 2021). Third, as the mobility of Americans is overall
declining, geography matters more than ever (Molloy et al 2017). A lack
of credit hinders investments in better homes, better schools, better
local infrastructure such as roads and public transport, better
amenities, and better health care.</p>
